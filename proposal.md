# Preamble

Title: nft-barter Proposal document 

## Simple Summary
This is proposal document to describe nft-barter.

## Abstract 
This nft-barter is an open market where you can mint, buy, sell and swap your nft's within collection. The mint, buy and sell funtionality will be
the standard mplementation ERC-721 with some add-ons. We would have our implementation of swap nft where user can list item for swap, propose swap and
execute swap and pay-receive.

## Motivation
This idea is a widespread use case of trading / exchanging goods in both virtual and real world

#### Real world example: 
You have an iphone13 and you decide to switch to android,
  1. You put up your iphone available for exchange with samsung on an online marketplace where you also find someone having a samsung s20 willing to swap with iphone.
  2. To be noted in this case your iphone has more monetary value than the other party's samsung 20 thus along with the swap you would also want to receive money with it that both parties agree upon. 
  3. NFT swap and pay-receive should be able to perform this kind of deal for NFT in a non custodial way.

#### Virtual example:

In gaming items buy / sell / trade is very common too. Dmarket is one of the markets for this purpose. Here is a video explaining the same use case for game skins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F45Ni6x9q0k
